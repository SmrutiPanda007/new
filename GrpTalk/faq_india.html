        <h3>How grpTalk works</h3>

        <div id="accordion1">

            <h3>Can I receive a call from grpTalk if I don’t have my cellular data turned on or an active internet connection?</h3>

            <div><p>3G or internet is not required to receive a call. However cellular data (3G or faster) or internet is required to schedule a call and to control the call using the app.</p></div>


            <h3>Do my friends and family need grpTalk app to receive my grpTalk calls?</h3>

            <div><p>App is not required to receive a call from grpTalk. However, to host your own grpTalk you need to download the app.</p></div>


            <h3>Can I add a contact to grpTalk which is not in my phone contact book?</h3>

            <div><p>Yes, you can add a number to the live call using a “dial pad”. Once your call is live, open the grpTalk app, select the live group call (manage), click on “Add member” icon and choose “dial pad”. Type in number and press “call”, it will be added to the live call.</p></div>


            <h3>What should I do if I missed a grpTalk call?</h3>
            <div><p>You can always join a grpTalk by calling that number you got a missed call from as long as the talk is ongoing.</p></div>


            <h3>Why is there no PIN to join a grpTalk?</h3>
            <div><p>You can join a grpTalk only if you are invited. Therefore no PIN is necessary.</p></div>

            <h3>Does my network charge me for receiving a call from grpTalk?</h3>
            <div><p>Since incoming calls are free, you will not be charged.</p></div>

            <h3>Will other members be able to participate in the grpTalk without the host joining?</h3>
            <div><p>Yes, other members can start the grpTalk without the host.</p></div>

            <h3>If my call is disconnected due to some reason, while my grpTalk is in progress, how can I connect to my live grpTalk?</h3>
            <div><p>To reconnect you can always call the grpTalk number you received a call from.</p></div>

            <h3>Can I use my account on multiple phones? Will I lose my grpTalk history?</h3>
            <div><p>No, you can only use it on one phone at a time. If you activate your account on another phone your account will be 						deactivated on the old phone and grpTalk history will be transferred to the new phone.</p></div>

            <h3>What if some of my contacts are on DND, will grpTalk still be able to call them?</h3>
            <div><p>If some of the members in your group are on DND, you (host) will be prompted to send them an SMS from your mobile asking them to opt-in. Only those that opt-in will receive a call from grpTalk at scheduled time.</p></div>

            <h3>Can I call other countries using grpTalk?</h3>
            <div><p>Currently you can only call members within the country. International calling is coming soon.</p></div>
