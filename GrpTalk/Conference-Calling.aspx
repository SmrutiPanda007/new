                        <p>grpTalk allows simple group calling on your mobile. Basically it is a traditional conference call turnedinside out. Instead of you calling in, you will be called out by the grpTalk number. All you have to do is answer the phone and connect to your group. No more remembering PINs and conference IDs.</p>
                        <p>As we use PSTN / Mobile carrier connectivity and not VOIP connectivity, we promise you crystal clear call quality and greater reach to every nook and corner of the country.</p>
